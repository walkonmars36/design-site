    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I havenâ€™t taken the typical route to becoming a freelance web designer.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first experience of designing websites was 17 years ago, when I
      co-created two sites for the sustainable printing business that my wife
      and I ran together.
    </p>
    <p>
      We worked with local artists, helping to promote their work by printing
      their designs onto t-shirts and selling them at festivals and online.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also ran a not-for-profit print studio where artists could come and use
      the facilities to create their own work and printed commercially for
      charities, not-for-profits and small sustainable businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      My passion for colour and design, vital in printing, naturally crossed
      over into the web world. From there I dabbled in web design, creating
      simple websites for friends and small businesses.
