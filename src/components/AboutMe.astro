    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I havenâ€™t taken the typical route to becoming a freelance web designer.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first experience of designing websites was 17 years ago, when I
      co-created two sites for the sustainable printing business that my wife
      and I ran together.
    </p>
    <p>
      We worked with local artists, helping to promote their work by printing
      their designs onto t-shirts and selling them at festivals and online.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also ran a not-for-profit print studio where artists could come and use
      the facilities to create their own work and printed commercially for
      charities, not-for-profits and small sustainable businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      My passion for colour and design, vital in printing, naturally crossed
      over into the web world. From there I dabbled in web design, creating
      simple websites for friends and small businesses.

        In 2020, as happened to many people, my business stalled as we all went
        into lock-down. I took time to reflect on my work and consider the
        aspects of it that brought me joy - I found that it was web design and
        development that really excited and compelled me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the last four years I have studied x, y and z - running my own
        business means that I am very self motivated! Learning as much as I can
        to be able to offer a cross-section of website options to anyone looking
        for a bespoke, affordable and xxxxx site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work I am a musician, a dad, a husband, a lover of film,
        football and good ale, oh and the pet-dad to a soppy unconditionally
        loving black labrador called Rocket.
