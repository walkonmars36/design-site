        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="huge-5">
          I havenâ€™t taken the typical route to becoming a freelance web
          designer.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first experience of designing websites was 17 years ago, when I
          co-created two sites for the sustainable printing business that my
          wife and I ran together.
        </p>

        <p>
          We worked with local artists, helping to promote their work by
          printing their designs onto t-shirts and selling them at festivals and
          online.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also ran a not-for-profit print studio where artists could come and
          use the facilities to create their own work and printed commercially
          for charities, not-for-profits and small sustainable businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for colour and design, vital in printing, naturally crossed
          over into the web world. From there I dabbled in web design, creating
          simple websites for friends and small businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020, as happened to many people, my business stalled as we all
          went into lock-down. I took time to reflect on my work and consider
          the aspects of it that brought me joy - I found that it was web design
          and development that really excited and compelled me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the last four years I have studied x, y and z - running my own
          business means that I am very self motivated! Learning as much as I
          can to be able to offer a cross-section of website options to anyone
          looking for a bespoke, affordable and xxxxx site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work I am a musician, a dad, a husband, a lover of film,
          football and good ale, oh and the pet-dad to a soppy unconditionally
          loving black labrador called Rocket.
