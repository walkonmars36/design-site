        <h3>Web Design</h3>
        <p>
          My focus is on creating clean, modern designs prioritising user
          experience (UX) and accessibility best practices that aim for an
          inclusive and intuitive experience for all users.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use Figma, the leading user interface (UI) design tool, to craft web
          designs with interactive prototyping, which means you'll be able to
          see a working model of your website before the actual build.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach allows for client feedback and refinement, providing
          opportunities for quick adjustments and redesigns before finalizing
          the design that will go on to be developed.
        </p>

        <h3>WordPress development</h3>
        <p>
          I build custom WordPress sites using Oxygen or Bricks builder,
          allowing me to prioritise both speed of development and client
          usability. Sites are hosted on eco friendly servers and optimized for
          WordPress performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my knowledge of CSS and JavaScript, along with PHP and custom
          theme creation, I can also customise existing sites built with
          WordPress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether customising code on your existing website or building a new
          site from scratch, I work hard to ensure each WordPress website I
          build meets your unique requirements.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flow wfw">
        <h3>Webflow development</h3>
        <p>
          As an advanced visual coding tool, this platform enables rapid
          development and easy, on page client editing, making it a great choice
          for clients who want to maintain their own site. Webflow also has a
          powerful CMS, which allows for easy content management and dynamic
          content creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Webflow is also renowned for its interaction and animation tools,
          which can be used to create engaging and dynamic websites.
          Functionality can also be further enhanced with JavaScript and custom
          CSS for tailored solutions.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flow shp">
        <h3>Shopify</h3>
        <p>
          Drawing from first hand experience of running my own ecommerce store,
          I recommend Shopify as a platform that is easy to use and maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst it's entirely possible to build a store using a pre-made theme,
          I can also create custom frontends or modify existing themes to meet
          the requirements of the project, whilst also integrating third-party
          apps and services to enhance the functionality of your store.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flow fed">
        <h3>Frontend Development</h3>
        <p>
          While I'm primarily focussed on client-friendly platforms like
          WordPress, Webflow, and Shopify, I'm also a frontend developer with a
          passion for creating clean, modern, and responsive websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm in my happy place when working in a code editor, writing HTML, CSS
          and JavaScript. I've built projects in dynamic frontend frameworks
          like ReactJS and static site generators like Astro, which this site is
          built in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it's enhancing an existing site with responsive layouts and a
          focus on accessibility, or building one from scratch with dynamic user
          interfaces, I ensure a seamless and engaging user experience across
          all devices and browsers.

      <div class="flow seo">
        <h3>SEO</h3>
        <p>
          While SEO isn't my primary focus, I continuously strive to implement
          best practices into my code.
        </p>
        <p>
          By optimizing website structures and content, conducting technical SEO
          audits, and implementing on-page optimization strategies like keyword
          research and content optimization, I aim to improve search engine
          visibility and drive organic traffic.
