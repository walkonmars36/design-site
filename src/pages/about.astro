              In 2006 I taught myself HTML and CSS then in 2007, along with my
              wife, I setup one of the first t-shirt printers in the UK to focus
              on using only ethically produced garments and eco-friendly
              printing practices. Over the following years I built several
              simple websites to promote our print business.

              When I started an online shop to promote my design range I first
              used Whilst these platforms allowed me to produce a decent
              ecommerce site I felt frustrated that I wasn&#39;t able to control
              every aspect of the build and would always delve into the code to
              try and change it.

              Fast forward to 2020 and with the immense impact of the Covid
              pandemic, the business, like many, was greatly affected and I
              found myself re-evaluating my situation. I recognised that my love
              of web design and development was still strong. I&#39;d never been
              happier than when working on websites. So, since March 2020 I have
              become more engrossed in web development, studying through online
              courses and also a 12 week full stack bootcamp run by{" "}
              <a
                class="about-me__nology"
                href="https://nology.io/"
                target="_blank"
              >
                _nology
              </a>{" "}
              which ran from May - July 2022.

          </div>
        </section>
        <p>
          Since completing the bootcamp I have been practising and expanding my
          knowledge of CSS, JavaScript and React and also learnt some basic
          Python and Django to expand my knowledge of backend development.

          My aim is to work in an ethical environment to use my newly developed
          skills for good. Working with not for profits, charities or
          environmental agencies.
