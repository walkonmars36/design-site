    "objective": "Timothy Malnick, a leadership coach, facilitator, and organisational psychologist, needed a website that reflected his expertise and professional services. His existing site was outdated, difficult to navigate, and content-heavy, making it less effective for web audiences. The goal was to create an easy-to-navigate site that showcased his services, provided a platform for his blog, and adopted a punchier, more web-friendly style of writing.",
    "process": "Tim provided a detailed brief and extensive content, reflecting his skill in long-form writing. It took careful collaboration to guide him toward a more concise style suitable for the web. After auditing his existing site, I designed the new layout in Figma and developed it in WordPress using Oxygen Builder, incorporating custom PHP and JavaScript for specific functionality. The site was optimized for SEO and performance, leading to faster load times and improved visibility.",
    "result": "Tim was delighted with the final website, which now balances his expertise in content creation with a clear, user-friendly design. Clients and colleagues have provided excellent feedback, praising the site’s modern aesthetic, ease of navigation, and concise, impactful copy.",
